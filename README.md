# Kimia Farma Dashboard Report

## Intro

This project aims to create a datamart and dashboard to visualize the report of products that are sold by Kimia Farma. This is a part of my Virtual Internship Experience Program facilitated by [Rakamin](Rakamin.com).
The dataset was provided by Rakamin and Kimia Farma. Besides the final task, we were also taught by experts about big data frameworks and how to create a data mart from a data warehouse.

## Tools
- PostgreSQL
- Google Data Studio

## Work Stages
1. Create Data Mart from a Data Warehouse using PostgreSQL
2. From the Data Mart we create an aggregated dataset to further analyze each product
3. Using Data Mart as the source, create a dashboard that can be understood by the upper management about the business performance of each product

## Final Result
The dashboard can be accessed from [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/fc97a8c7-4aa4-41b5-a31e-5193fdcd1da4). In this dashboard, we can filter the data that we want to see based on 
- the brand of the product, 
- the product itself,
- the city where all the products are being sold, 
- and by the date.

The main headline will be 
- the number of products sold,
- number of transactions made, 
- and the revenue generated. 

I also added a table that summarizes 
- the average selling price of each product, 
- the deviation of the price to analyze the selling price and whether it is necessary to make a price regulation for the product,
- and the total revenue generated by each product
